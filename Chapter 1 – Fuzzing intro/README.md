# Chapter 1 â€“ Fuzzing Introduction

This chapter introduces various fuzzing techniques, focusing on the core methodologies used to test and secure software systems. Below is an overview of the main fuzzing strategies covered:

## Overview of Fuzzing Techniques

### 1. CodeQL Analysis

A static analysis tool that helps identify vulnerabilities in codebases by querying the abstract syntax tree. This section includes instructions on how to perform CodeQL analysis for detecting security flaws.

### 2. Fuzzing Component Overview

An illustration of the key components involved in a fuzzing system, providing insight into how fuzzers generate and execute test cases against the target software.

### 3. Grammar-Based Fuzzing

Grammar-based fuzzing generates inputs based on a predefined set of grammatical rules, allowing for the testing of programs that process structured inputs like parsers or interpreters.

### 4. Greybox & Blackbox Fuzzing

* **Blackbox Fuzzing**: The fuzzer treats the target as a black box, without any knowledge of its internal structure, and randomly generates test cases.
* **Greybox Fuzzing**: Combines elements of both whitebox and blackbox fuzzing, utilizing lightweight instrumentation to guide input generation based on feedback from the target program.

### 5. Mutation-Based Fuzzing

Mutation-based fuzzing takes valid inputs and slightly modifies (mutates) them to generate new test cases, stressing the program with variations of known valid data.

### 6. Random Fuzzing

Random fuzzing generates inputs entirely at random, without any specific knowledge about the program or the type of input it expects.

### 7. Search-Based Fuzzing

Search-based fuzzing uses search algorithms to find inputs that maximize coverage or trigger specific program behaviors, focusing on areas of the program that are less frequently tested.
